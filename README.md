# ATM-Simulator-in-Java
This is a console-based mini ATM simulator written in Java. The program mimics the basic functionalities of an Automated Teller Machine (ATM),
including:  PIN-based authentication:
            Only users who enter the correct PIN (1234 by default) can access ATM options.
            Withdrawing cash:
            Allows users to withdraw a specific amount, with a balance check for insufficient funds.
            Checking account balance:
            Displays the current account balance.
